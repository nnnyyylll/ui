# data-component
automatically search on the DOM for components that match with you javascript classes and instantiate it.

## Why
I'm tired of apply a `document.querySelectorAll` and for each component on the DOM, instantiate a new class manually, like this:

```javascript
[...document.querySelectorAll('[data-my-component]')].forEach($element => new MyComponent($element));
```
It's seems ok for one case, but as you component library grows, its turn out a  messy.


## How to use
Consider the follow case for and Article component:


### 1. Declare your components on the DOM

```html
  <article data-component="Article">...</article>
```

### 2. Create a javascript `Class`:


```javascript
// Your class name should match with the DOM data-component="_NAME_" selector;
Class Article {
  // The first parameter on your constructor will be the DOM Element
  constructor($article) {
    this.$article = $article;
  }

 // Declare your build method to anything you like:
  build() {
    this.$article.innerHTML = '<p>Hello world!</p>'
  }
}
```

### 3. Register you class into a `DataComponent` instance
after register all components that you want, call `run` method.

```javascript
  new DataComponent([Article]).run();
```
